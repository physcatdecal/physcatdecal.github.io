This homework is due on 8 April 2021. Please submit a PDF of your project proposal to Gradescope. Project proposals should be about 1-2 pages in length, and should include the following details:

- Your name, and the name of your project partner if any
- A project title
- A brief description, around 1 paragraph, of what you want to do (e.g. learn a certain package, simulate some effect), why you're interested in it, and optionally how it will prepare you for research work going forward.
- A rough outline of code structure, e.g. a list of functions you'll need to implement. It's fine if this changes - we just want to be sure everyone thinks a bit about it now.
