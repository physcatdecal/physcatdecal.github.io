      <description>PhysCat (Physics High-Performance Scientific Computing and Technology) is a 2-Unit Decal now open for enrolement as PHYS198 003, CN:33406! If you enjoyed learning about computing in Physics 77 and want to use it in real research, this class is for you!
We aim to give you the working knowledge of often glossed over topics like computer architecture, hardware acceleration, probilistic programming, and practical software development techniques you will need to become a better researcher!</description>
