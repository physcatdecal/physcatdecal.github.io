      <description>This homework is due on 8 February 2021 at 11:59PM via Gradescope. Please submit a .zip file containing
 physcat_sp21_hw1_p1.ipynb physcat_sp21_hw1_p3.ipynb  which you can download below.
Setup Welcome to PhysCat! Like many courses, the first thing you&amp;rsquo;re going to have to do is set up a programming environment that has all the libraries you&amp;rsquo;ll need. For at least the first portion of this course we will be using anaconda to handle package management.</description>
