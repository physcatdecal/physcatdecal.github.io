      <description>PhysCat (Physics High-Performance Scientific Computing and Technology) is a 2-Unit Decal now open for enrollment as PHYS198 003, CN:33406! If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in practical applications of HPC and Scientific computing for research or fun, then this class is for you!
We aim to give you the working knowledge of often glossed over topics like computer architecture, hardware acceleration, probilistic programming, and practical software development techniques you will need to become a better researcher!</description>

      <description>This homework is due on 8 February 2021 at 11:59PM via Gradescope. Please submit a .zip file containing
 physcat_sp21_hw1_p1.ipynb physcat_sp21_hw1_p3.ipynb  which you can download below.
Setup Welcome to PhysCat! Like many courses, the first thing you&amp;rsquo;re going to have to do is set up a programming environment that has all the libraries you&amp;rsquo;ll need. For at least the first portion of this course we will be using anaconda to handle package management.</description>
