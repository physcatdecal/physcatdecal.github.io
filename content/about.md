PhysCat (Physics High-Performance Scientific Computing and Technology) is a 2-Unit Decal now open for enrolement as `PHYS198 003, CN:33406`! If you enjoyed learning about computing in Physics 77 and want to use it in real research, this class is for you!

We aim to give you the working knowledge of often glossed over topics like computer architecture, hardware acceleration, probilistic programming, and practical software development techniques you will need to become a better researcher!

We will have lectures Mondays and office hours/discussion Wednesdays from 7-8 PM. Lectures will be recorded and we're happy to set up alternate OH based on student availability. Students should be familiar with basic programming, and we'll begin with two weeks of setup and review to make sure everyone is on board. For more information check out the [Syllabus](https://aditya-sengupta.github.io/PhysCat_DeCal_Syllabus.pdf), and if you have additional questions feel free to reach out to us by email!
