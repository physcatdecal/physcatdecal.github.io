    "Python data essentially comes in several basic types, or in custom types that are constructed using these basic ones. In programming languages, a variable is a reserved spot in computer memory that stores a particular value or a reference to an object. All languages have variables, but variables in Python are *dynamically* typed (unlike other statically-typed languages like Java). This means that you can define a variable `x` to be a certain type (e.g. int) and then later in your code assign `x` to a different type (e.g. string).\n",
