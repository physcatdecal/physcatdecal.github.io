Server Access To complete this homework, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to run both notebooks on the course Jupyter server to make use of our GPU. Directions for accessing the server will be distributed on Discord. Since we have limited compute resources, please don&amp;rsquo;t distribute access credentials or use significantly more resources than the notebooks specify.</description>
