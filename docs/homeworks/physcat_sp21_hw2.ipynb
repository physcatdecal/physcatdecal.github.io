    "For this assignment we have created the Catatonic Processor, an imaginary Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) that should hopefully be fairly easy to learn compared to the convoluted mess of ISAs like [x86](https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/). (If you'd like to learn more about a real ISA, take a look at Berkeley's very own [RISC-V](https://github.com/jameslzhu/riscv-card/blob/master/riscv-card.pdf)).\n",

    "## Catatonic Processor\n",
    "\n",
    "Catatonic instructions are formed with Python tuples and execute from an instance of the `Memory` class, which is essentially a wrapper around a list. (A class instance is, roughly speaking, a custom object that the programmer can define: `MachineState` and `Memory` below are both these kinds of objects.) For example the following code would instantiate an instance of the catatonic processor with 256 memory slots, add two registers, and output the result:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "m = MachineState(Memory(256))\n",
    "\n",
    "program = Memory([\n",
    "    (ADD, T0, T2, A0),\n",
    "    (OUT, T0)\n",
    "])\n",
    "\n",
    "m.run_program(program)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a lot of code that instantiates the simulator. At the top, you can see all of the instructions we have defined. If you're interested, feel free to peruse the code. Then you can run the cell, and minimize it if you're on JupyterLab.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fun CS Principles Teaching Moment**: this is a fun example of an abstraction barrier! You don't have to know how the instruction set works internally to be able to use it in later questions. It might help you understand some things, but you can understand bigger objects by themselves. For example you don't need to know *how* `MachineState` interprets register names and retrieves values: you just need to know that it *does*.\n",

    "### Registers\n",
    "\n",
    "Catatonic is what is often referred to as a \"[RISC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer)\" ISA. One consequence of this is that most of its operations are *Register to Register* operations. This makes it very important to understand what registers are, and how to use them appropriately and safely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost all computers built today are what's called [register machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_machine). This roughly means your computer has a fixed number of prenamed variables that can be operated on by the instructions. They are generally very fast to access (the computer I am writing this on can access them in less then a quarter of a nanosecond, the amount of time it takes for light to travel 3 inches). In comparison the main memory of your computer (your RAM) has an access latency hundreds to thousands of times larger. Therefore, to extract maximum performance from a computer, you want as much of your computation as possible to happen in registers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Catatonic has 3 sets of 8 general-purpose registers. These are functionally identical, but have distinct intended usages that I strongly recommend you adhere to.\n",
    "\n",
    "The A0-A7 registers are there for passing arguments and storing return values, so if I wrote a function to count the number of even numbers in a list, it might take the address of the list in A0, the length of the list in A1, and return the number of evens it found back in A0.\n",
    "\n",
    "The T0-T7 registers are there for storing temporary data, so you might store an intermediate result of some sum computation in T2 for example. By convention T0-T7 are not preserved across function calls. This means if your function calls another function, the function you called may overwrite these registers without care if it so wishes. (See Section: Calling convention)\n",
    "\n",
    "The S0-S7 are the opposite of the temporaries (saved registers). If you call a function, then by convention if that function uses any of these for its own purposes, it must save the original value somewhere and restore it upon returning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Catatonic also has 3 \"Special\" registers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest of these is ZZ, reading from ZZ will always result in a zero, and writing to it will simply discard the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "The IP (instruction pointer) register stores the address of the instruction currently executing. It is not intended to be directly read or written to, but you can do this if you're very brave.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that we have the RA register; by convention RA is used to save the instruction pointer during a call, so the called function knows where to go back to when it returns its result.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Arithmetic Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "The majority of the ISA is made up of arithmetic instructions that take 1-2 source operands and a destination operand. (We've also been calling operands \"arguments\".) For example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    (ADD, DEST, SOURCEA, SOURCEB),\n",
    "```\n",
    "would add SOURCEA and SOURCEB and store them into the destination operand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Source operands may be either registers or literal numbers, so both of the following are valid:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    (ADD, T0, A0, S0),\n",
    "    (SUB, T1, A1, 3),\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Arithmetic instructions are generally executed the way you would read them, so the first instruction there would perform T0 = A0 + S0, and the second would perform T1 = A1 - 3, as is generally the convention for most assembly languages. For a full listing of these, see the cell at the top. ADD through SLT are all of the arithmetic instructions that follow this form.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Misilaneous Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Catatonic has two instructions that don't really fit into any other category;\n",
    "\n",
    "The HLT (halt) instruction ends the execution of your program and causes the simulator to exit. We use this to end the program when our test is complete:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    (ADD, T0, 1, 3), # Runs\n",
    "    (HLT),\n",
    "    (MUL, T0, 2, 3), # Doesn't Run\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The other instruction that doesn't really fit is the OUT instruction. This prints out its argument to the console (additionally the `run_program` function provides a list of all outputs upon exiting). This is intended to be used for debugging, and to export the results of your function to the user/a test.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    (OUT, 5),  # Would print \"5\" to the console\n",

    "### Memory/Stack Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Catatonic has two types of storage beyond registers, the stack and main memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Memory\n",
    "Main memory is basically one big list/array that can be accessed by the indexes (generally called pointers) of the data inside that you would like to access. These pointers generally need to be stored in registers (you can store them in memory, but then you need pointers to those pointers). In order to copy data between the registers and main memory Catatonic provides two instructions, load (LD) and store (ST).\n",
    "\n",
    "Load takes a value from some location in memory and copies that into the register of your choosing, so for example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    (LD, T0, A0),\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "would take the data at the address given by A0 and copy it into T0.\n",
    "\n",
    "For your convenience, load also supports indexed loads, with a base address and an offset, so for example if A0 stored the address of an array, and you wanted to access element 7, you would do\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    (LD, T0, A0, 7)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "which would grab the value at `A0 + 7` (fun fact, this is why most languages index arrays and lists starting from zero, because the first element is at BASE + 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "Store works essentially the same way, but in reverse, so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    (ST, T0, A0, 4)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Would copy the contents of T0 into the memory location `A0 + 4`\n",
    "\n",
    "Main memory is generally very slow, so most processors have a small amount of RAM directly on their silicon dies that only take a couple of clock cycles to read from. For example, [my computer](https://www.anandtech.com/show/15708/amds-mobile-revival-redefining-the-notebook-business-with-the-ryzen-9-4900hs-a-review/2#Caching) can read from cache in 4 clock cycles, 4 times the time it takes to access a register).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stack\n",
    "[Stacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)) are very common data structures in computer science and are incredibly simple. The generally have two operations, push which adds a value to the end of the stack, and pop, which removes a value from the end (these were originally called Bury and Unbury by Alan Turing). You can think of push like the append function, and pop as reading the last value in a list and then removing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most computers store their stack as a data structure in memory, but in order to simplify things we have a completely seperate stack data structure. It can be accessed with the two instructions PSH and POP:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    (PSH, A0), # Would push the value in A0 onto the bottom of the stack\n",
    "    (POP, T0), # Takes the value pushed by the previous instruction and stores it in T0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Stacks are a great way to store data that you don't have room for in registers because they are relatively fast (generally your stack will always be in cache), and you don't need to keep around a pointer to access data because it is always on a predictable place on the stack. The price you pay for this is that stacks can't easily handle data that lack a fixed length, like lists. Instead, these are typically stored in main memory with a pointer to them kept on the stack or in a register. (If you hear someone talking about storing stuff on the 'heap' this is what they mean).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Stack is a perfect place to save registers in called functions. For example, if your function used the register S2 you would need to save and restore it upon entry and exit, in case the function calling you used it. You could express that quite simply by doing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    (PSH, S2), # Save the original value of S2\n",
    "    ...Your Computation Here...\n",
    "    (POP, S2), # Restore your saved value to S2\n",

    "- When calling another function, a function should store the address of the instruction after the call in RA\n",
    "- In order to return, a function should jump to the address stored in RA\n",
